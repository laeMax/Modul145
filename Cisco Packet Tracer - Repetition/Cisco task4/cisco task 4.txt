Ping from 172.16.31.5 to 172.16.31.2
Ping from 172.16.31.3 to 171.16.31.2
Ping from 172.16.31.5 to 171.16.31.4

1.     Were there different types of cables/media used to connect devices?
rj45 and wireless

2.     Did the cables change the handling of the PDU in any way?
no, except that the cables are usually faster.

3.     Did the Hub lose any of the information that it received?
No only the data It send to .3 which was not supposed to be there.

4.     What does the Hub do with MAC addresses and IP addresses?

5.     Did the wireless Access Point do anything with the information given to it?
it sends it to the 2 Computer connected to it.

6.     Was any MAC or IP address lost during the wireless transfer?
No

7.     What was the highest OSI layer that the Hub and Access Point used?
Layer 3

8.     Did the Hub or Access Point ever replicate a PDU that was rejected with a red “X”?
No

9.     When examining the PDU Details tab, which MAC address appeared first, the source or the destination?
The Source

10.  Why would the MAC addresses appear in this order?
Because thats where its first sent from.

11.  Was there a pattern to the MAC addressing in the simulation?
It tried to go multiple if it didnt know the way.

12.  Did the switches ever replicate a PDU that was rejected with a red “X”?
No only the Access Point.

13.  Every time that the PDU was sent between the 10 network and the 172 network, there was a point where the MAC addresses suddenly changed. Where did that occur?

14.  Which device uses MAC addresses that start with 00D0:BA?
The Router

15.  What devices did the other MAC addresses belong to?
The Device who currently holds the packet.

16.  Did the sending and receiving IPv4 addresses change fields in any of the PDUs?
Yes for example the Destination Address

17.  When you follow the reply to a ping, sometimes called a pong, do you see the sending and receiving IPv4 addresses switch?
Yes

18.  What is the pattern to the IPv4 addressing used in this simulation?
A pyramid

19.  Why do different IP networks need to be assigned to different ports of a router?
because there could be a loop back 

20.  If this simulation was configured with IPv6 instead of IPv4, what would be different?
The IP.
